## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

We would like to analyze and compare various topics in relation to each other in our chosen tourism dataset. This could include comparing our chosen ideas from 2014 to 2017, as well as being able to compare the amount of tourism spending in different categories within the chosen dataset. As we live in an area with high tourism rates we would like to explore the growth trends of overall tourism in BC in comparison to Canada. We would like to explore:
- Where are the majority of BCs tourists coming from: domestically or out-of-province? 
- What is BCs overall tourism growth rate from 2014-2017? What is Canada's overall tourism growth rate in that same time? How do they compare?
- Are people spending more money on hotels or campsites when they visit? Is this different from Canada’s hotel/campsite statistics? 

Another point of interest would be tourist spending on alcohol. As well as, looking at what percentage of Canada’s profit from tourism comes from BC and which categories bring the most profit. We believe we could make a very interesting dashboard with our data set.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The data set we have chosen is one about supply and demand related to tourism by-products in Canada. These by-products include imports (supply), exports (demand), tourism product ratios, among many more in all domestic, interprovincial and international fields. This will help us be able to attain various data analysis ideas and sets within the larger dataset. Furthermore, It also explores dozens of categories for each by-product such as; accommodation, transportation, the amount spent on alcohol beverages, the amount spent in restaurants, and many other various tourism categories. The dataset further breaks these categories down for each province and territory within Canada, which is great for contrasting and comparing many different areas of interest. This data set was collected by Statistics Canada for the years of 2014 and 2017. As the study was conducted by Statistics Canada it was most likely for economic/ political reasons, transparency, and public knowledge.
